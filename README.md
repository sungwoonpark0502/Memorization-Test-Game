# Memorization-Test-Game

I have referred to the NadoCoding YouTube Channel Video when programming this Game.
This code does not belong to me and was done just for my practice with python and game developing.

Only the 7th python file is needed to run the Game.
Other 6 python files are the progress of the process.
